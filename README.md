Car Selection Select UI Modal to choose Car Model and Brand was implemented on a Single-Page Application using Angular framework.
Angular Material Component <mat-select> is used for selecting a value in both Model and brand from a set of options.
The values of Model and Brand are passed in directly without API requests because of CORS issue.
The User Interface Modal is developed in such a way so that it is user-resposive.
